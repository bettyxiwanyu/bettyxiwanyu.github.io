[EuroAgeism](https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/764632) is focused on harmonising different theoretical and methodological disciplines in the field of ageism. It aims to bring together science and policy by creating an opportunity for a true dialogue that will allow graduates of the program to capture positions as scientists, educators, science advisers, policy advocates, lobbyists, or legislators in the field of ageism.

"Reducing older adults' self-stigma to increase the accessibility of technology" is the No.15 sub-projects within the EuroAgeism framework. This study employs a randomized-controlled trial methodology to examine whether an intervention which reduces self-ageism among older adults results in improved accessibility to technology. The study is fuelled by the premise that a major barrier to accessing technology among older adults is self-perceived ageism. Hence, by lifting this barrier, it is expected that older adults will be more inclined to access technology.
